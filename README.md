# AI Coding Essentials

Three-afternoon workshop on essential AI coding skills for data science beginners.

## Overview

This repository contains four hands-on Jupyter notebook exercises designed to teach fundamental data science skills. Each notebook includes explanations, TODO tasks, and opportunities to create outputs you can share.

## Notebooks

### 1. JSON Basics (`01_json_basics.ipynb`)
Learn the fundamentals of working with JSON data in Python:
- Creating JSON objects and nested data structures
- Converting JSON to Pandas DataFrames
- Saving and loading JSON files
- Working with JSON strings and APIs

### 2. Markdown Fundamentals (`02_markdown_fundamentals.ipynb`)
Master Markdown for documentation and communication:
- Headers, text formatting, and lists
- Links, images, and tables
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Generating documentation from data

### 3. Interactive Mapping with Folium (`03_interactive_mapping_folium.ipynb`)
Create beautiful interactive maps:
- Understanding geographic coordinates
- Adding markers and custom icons
- Creating rich HTML popups
- Using different map styles
- Saving and sharing maps

### 4. Pandas Data Analysis (`04_pandas_data_analysis.ipynb`)
Perform comprehensive data analysis:
- Loading and exploring CSV data
- Data filtering, sorting, and aggregation
- Creating visualizations with Matplotlib
- Combining Pandas data with Folium maps
- Complete end-to-end data analysis projects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mroswell/ai-coding-essentials.git
cd ai-coding-essentials
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open any notebook to begin learning!

## Recommended Order

Work through the notebooks in numerical order:
1. Start with JSON basics to understand data structures
2. Learn Markdown for documentation skills
3. Explore Folium for geographic visualization
4. Complete the Pandas notebook that combines everything

## What You'll Create

Each notebook includes exercises and challenges where you'll create:
- JSON data files
- Markdown documentation and reports
- Interactive HTML maps
- Data visualizations (charts and graphs)
- Complete data analysis projects

**Share your outputs!** Take screenshots of your visualizations and export your maps to showcase your learning.

## Tips for Success

- Complete all TODO tasks in each notebook
- Try the challenge exercises at the end of each notebook
- Experiment with your own data and ideas
- Share your work with classmates or colleagues
- Save your notebooks regularly

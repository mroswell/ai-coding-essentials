### Class 1: Even a Non-Coder can do custom web development

**Sharing:** What are your AI Coding ideas and intentions? General knowledge? Specific projects? 

- (2 minutes per person; We have 4 students)



**Focus:** Web formats and GitHub Pages deployment

- Learn HTML, JSON, CSV, and Markdown with an AI chatbot, then build and deploy an interactive quiz for GitHub Pages.

**Focus:** Overview of Projects the instructor has built with AI 

- My Chat Search; YouTube Transcript Button; Deduplicate Images, Tag and search thousands of FOIA Documents, Describe images, navigate a large document

**Focus:** The AI Essentials Progress Tracker


**HOMEWORK**
1. Complete this git tutorial - https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/hello-git
2. Visit and understand this thread: https://claude.ai/share/00a093fb-1abd-4b64-aca9-9b82ae3f4600, based on this page: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
3. Try to build a portfolio website with https://techfolios.github.io/. If you don't care about a portfolio, build a GitHub Pages website of your choice. Ideas: Quiz, Class Notes, Tutorial
4. Spend 5 minutes Filling out your Progress tracker. Optional: Share your results
5. Read your email for Telegram Invite


### Class 2: Data Analysis and Visualization

**Focus:** Navigating in a Python Notebook on Google Colab

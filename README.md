## Workshop Structure

### Afternoon 1: Build Your Portfolio Website
**Focus:** Web formats and deployment

Learn YAML, HTML, and Markdown with an AI chatbot, then build and deploy your portfolio website using GitHub Pages. You'll have a live site at `yourusername.github.io` by the end of the session.

### Afternoon 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
**Focus:** Data formats and interactive projects

Learn CSV and JSON formats, then use Google Colab to build interactive maps and analyze datasets with Python. Create visualizations you can add to your portfolio.

### Afternoon 3: Professional Development Workflows
**Focus:** Organization and best practices

Use GitHub Codespaces to organize your projects professionally, convert notebooks to proper Python scripts, and update your portfolio with your completed work.

## Workshop Structure

### Class 1: Even a Non-Coder can do custom web development

**Focus:** Quick overview of Projects the instructor has built with AI 
My Chat Search; YouTube Transcript Button; Deduplicate Images, Tag and search thousands of FOIA Documents, Describe images, navigate a large document

**Sharing:** What are your AI Coding ideas and intentions? General knowledge? Specific projects? (2 minutes per person; We have 4 students)

**Focus:** The AI Essentials Progress Tracker
Spend 5 minutes Filling out your Progress tracker. Optional: Share your results

**Focus:** Web formats and deployment

Learn HTML, JSON, CSV, and Markdown with an AI chatbot, then build and deploy an interactive quiz for GitHub Pages.


### Class 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
**Focus:** Data formats and interactive projects

Use Google Colab to build interactive maps and analyze datasets with Python. Create web visualizations you can add to your portfolio.

### Class 3: Professional Development Workflows
**Focus:** Organization and best practices

Use GitHub Codespaces to organize your projects professionally, convert notebooks to proper Python scripts, and update your portfolio with your completed work.
